"Decision Evaluation in Encrypted Domain" (deed) is an approach for securely evaluating encrypted Boolean expressions on encrypted bits without decryption. This is a Java implementation of the approach described in the paper below. We also provide a quick Javascript demo [here](https://rajesh-krishnan.github.io/deed/jsm/jsmdemo.html).
