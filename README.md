Decision Evaluation in Encrypted Domain: securely evaluating encrypted Boolean expressions on encrypted bits without decryption. This is a Java implementation of the approach described in the paper below. We also provide a quick Javascript demo in the jsm directory. After you clone the repo, you can go to the jsm directory and view `jsmdemo.html` in a browser.
